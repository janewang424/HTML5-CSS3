    <p>The <ins>Fronius Solar API</ins> is a means for third parties to obtain data from various Fronius devices (inverters, SensorCards StringControls) in a defined format through a central facility which acts as a proxy (e.g. Fronius Datalogger Web or Fronius Solar.web).</p>
    <p>Currently, the only way to interact with this <strong>API</strong> is by making a <strong><em>HTTP</em></strong> request to a specific CGI. The URLs for
        the particular requests and the devices supporting them are listed at the beginning of each request description.
        The API is versioned, meaning that multiple versions of this API may be available on the same device. The URLs
        in this document always point to the version of the API which this document describes. The highest supported
        version on the device can be queried. See 2.3.1 for details.<br />
        In order to check your product for compatibility with this version of the API specification, please see the separate
        document provided for this purpose.</p>
    <p><del>The API divides roughly into realtime and archive requests: Realtime requests will obtain the data directly from the
        devices and can therefore only be used when the devices are not in standby or unavailable in any other matter.
        Archive requests will use the data stored in a central logging facility to obtain the results and are of course not
        subjected to the former limitation.</del></p>
